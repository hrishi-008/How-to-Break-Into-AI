## Learning Path

### 1. Machine Learning Fundamentals
#### What is Machine Learning?
At its core, it's giving computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. You don't write rules. The model finds patterns.

#### Types of Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Using labeled data (e.g., spam vs. not spam)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error (used in gaming, robotics)

### 2. Supervised Learning
#### Key Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

#### Model Building 101
- Train/Test Split – never test on training data
- Evaluation Metrics – accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
- Cross-Validation – making models more reliable
- Overfitting & Underfitting – common pitfalls to avoid

- [Practical Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning)

### 3. Unsupervised Learning
#### Key Concepts
- Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Association Rules
- Anomaly Detection

#### Resources

- [Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/clustering-analysis)

### 4. Model Evaluation and Selection
- Performance Metrics
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Selection
- Ensemble Methods

#### Resources
- [Model Evaluation and Selection](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-modeling)
- [Advanced Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml)

## 🔧 Essential Tools
- scikit-learn for classical ML algorithms
- pandas & NumPy for data preparation
- matplotlib & seaborn for visualization
- TensorFlow and PyTorch for advanced applications

## Practice Projects
1. Predict housing prices
2. Classify emails as spam
3. Analyze customer churn
4. Develop an ensemble model

> Pro Tip: Don't try to memorize every algorithm. Focus on why they work and when to use them.

## ✅ End Goal of This Step
You should be able to:
- Build basic ML models from scratch
