Pick a Programming Language (Python Recommended)
AKA â€” how to stop scrolling and start coding.

If you're trying to break into AI, this is where your journey actually begins. Not with ChatGPT. Not with some flashy AI model demo. But with a blank .py file staring you in the face.

## Why Python?

Because Python is like the English of programming â€” simple, expressive, and everyone in AI speaks it.
Also, let's be honest: nobody's building LLMs in COBOL.

- Extensive AI/ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- Large community and resources
- Easy to learn and read
- Great for prototyping and production
- Excellent documentation

## Learning Path

### 1. Python Basics
#### ðŸ”¹ The Essentials:
- Syntax Basics: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions. Boring? Maybe. Necessary? Absolutely.
- Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples. These are your weapons â€” get comfy.
- OOP: Classes, objects, inheritance. You don't need to master this day 1, but you'll want to build muscle here soon.

### 2. Essential Programming Concepts
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow
- Functions and Modules
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Error Handling

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms
- Lists, Dictionaries, Sets
- Arrays and Matrices
- Basic Algorithms
- Time and Space Complexity

### 4. ðŸ”¹ AI-Specific Must-Knows:
- NumPy & pandas: Learn how to wrestle with data. If you can't slice a DataFrame, you're not ready for AI.
- matplotlib & seaborn: Visuals matter. Even your ML models want to be seen and understood.
- Jupyter Notebooks: This is your new lab. Get familiar with it â€” you'll spend a lot of time here.

## Practice Projects
1. Build a simple calculator
2. Create a to-do list application
3. Implement basic data structures
4. Data analysis project with real-world datasets

## âœ… End Goal of This Step:
You should be able to:
- Load and manipulate a dataset
- Write clean, readable Python code
- Build small programs that solve real problems (e.g., to-do list, weather app, basic calculator)
- Read code written by others without crying

## ðŸ‘€ Pro Tip
Don't get stuck in tutorial hell. Apply what you learn.
Build small things. Break them. Fix them. Repeat.
